As part of the course `Analyse von Prozess- und Produktdaten`, we wanted to imitate the evaluatiob models of the paper made by Heysem KAYA, Pınar TÜFEKCİ and Erdinç UZUN.

And we then compared our predictive results with the technical specification `CEN/TS 17198:2018`

We used models from Scikit-learn and XGBoost.
